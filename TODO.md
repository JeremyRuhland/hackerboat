# Hackerboat TODO v0.2

## Documentation

* ~~**Create system description document**~~
* ~~**Create controls specification**~~ -- Done to v0.2 requirements
* **Create overall wiring schematic**
* ~~**Move all documentation/code/designs to single GitHub repository**~~

## Operations

* **Create launching cradle/sling**
* ~~**Designate a safety officer**~~ -- 3ric volunteered to take this on
* **Prepare launch & recovery plan** 
* **Provide shade for shore station operator**

## Structure

*  **Fabricate & install solid battery mounts** -- PN has identified commercial products that meet the requirement, but has not yet acquired them.
* **Do weight and balance calculations** -- PN noted that since we verified that the boat floated flat and level without the batteries and keel, we can probably just get away with doing the keel plus batteries for now. 
* **Finish keel and add ballast bulbs**
* **Add keying to hatches** -- Partially complete thanks to Matt; epoxy is back

## Electrical

* **Replace external wiring for motor with stranded wire** -- Old wiring has been removed. New wiring is on hand but needs to be installed.
* **Re-work antenna** -- Replacement cables on hand.
* **Replace servo wiring** -- Old wiring has been removed. PN ordered a cable set with the wrong gender connector, so it needs to be replaced. 
* **Add cutoff & enable switches** -- 3ric has identified appropriate switches. Not acquired yet. 
* **Add mode lights aft** -- Need to acquire lights & cable
* ~~**Finalize assembly of control & relay boxes**~~ 
* **Functional test of control & relay boxes** -- PN has written & checked in code; still need to run it.
* **Improved control box mounting, esp wrt compass heading**

## Comms

* **Finalize radio box installation**
* **End to end comms test**
 
## Controls

* **Debug QGroundControl & our code such that mode switching (especially halt) works reliably without crashing**
* **Add manual steering mode (direct rudder control)** -- Added to Arduino code
* **Add throttle & reverse control** -- Added to Arduino code
* **Get GPS parsing & navigation working correctly**
* **Reduced gear ratio on steering servo** Need to order the parts
* **Add basic startup test (is voltage good? radio good? GPS good?)** -- Specified, implemented on the Arduino only
* **Monitor & report switch & voltage feedback already installed** -- Specified, not yet implemented.
