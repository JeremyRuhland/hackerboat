These packages need to be installed, along with their pre-requisites:

lighttpd
libsqlite3-dev
gcc-4.7
g++-4.7
cmake (to build jansson)
automake  (at least version 1.10)

These are not available as packages, but are fetched and built by a script:

https://github.com/yigityuce/BlackLib
https://github.com/akheron/jansson

These are useful for development and debugging:

sqlite3  (for inspecting database contents)
libgtest-dev (for the unit tests)

See https://github.com/cdsteinkuehler/beaglebone-universal-io for directions on how to make the IO work.
