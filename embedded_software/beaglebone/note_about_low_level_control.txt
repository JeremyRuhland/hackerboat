Sending
-------

 * MAVLINK_MSG_ID_HEARTBEAT
  * 1 per second
  * tells the beaglebone & groundcontroll you're still alive

  * Every few seconds?
  * Cell 1 voltage is our main battery voltage in mV

 * MAVLNK_MSG_ID_ATTITUDE
  * 1 per second
  * Roll/pitch/yaw are the important bits


Receiving
---------

 * MAVLINK_MSG_ID_HEARTBEAT from beaglebone
  * Figure out system state & mode
  * If mode is manual listen to manual control packets
  * If mode is automatic listen to nav controller output packets
  * If you see mode move from a disarmed to an armed state sound the horn or do the warning thing.
  * If state is critical/emergency take appropriate action
    
 * MAVLINK_MSG_ID_MANUAL_CONTROL from groundcontroll
  * Only act on these if you're currently in armed manual mode and active state

 * MAVLINK_MSG_ID_NAV_CONTROLLER_OUTPUT from beaglebone
  * Only act on these if you're currently in armed automatic mode and active state
